# Little training on JS 

The purpose here is to challenge your logical thinking on *Object-oriented programming* by recoding some functions of the famous *Lodash library*.

For your information, Lodash is released under the MIT license & supports modern environments and makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc. (https://lodash.com/)

Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:

  - Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
  - Manipulating & testing values
  - Creating composite functions


# Preparing the environment

```
# Cloning repository
git clone https://github.com/Raphabel/training-js.git training

# Fetching modules 
cd training
npm install
```

# Running tests

In order to challenge your skills on JS, you are invited to modifiy the file _myLodash.js_ and so complete the set of functions available in the file. It goes without to say that it is forbidden to make any call to the lodash library.

Once your code satisfies you, you can run the test in order to check your score:

```
npm start
```

Your final score will appear on your terminal and a log file will be generated in the folder _outputs_ where you can check on which function(s) you have failed or not.
